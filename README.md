# Node Cookie Stealer

## Usage
1. Clone Project
```
git clone https://github.com/TheWation/NodeCookieStealer
```

2. Install Node.js on your machine if you haven't already. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

3. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it using a terminal or command prompt.

4. Create a new file called app.js and copy the Node.js code into it.

5. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install express luxon
```
Run the following command to start the server:
```bash
node app.js
```
In your web browser, visit http://localhost:3000/c/your-cookie-value, replacing your-cookie-value with the value of the cookie that you want to log. For example, if the cookie value is ABC123, you would visit http://localhost:3000/c/ABC123.

The server will log the date and time, client IP address, user agent, referer, and cookie value to the cookies.txt file in the project directory.

The server will also return a response with a status code of 200 if the request was successful, or a status code of 500 if there was an error writing to the file.

You can repeat step 6 with different cookie values to log additional data to the file.
